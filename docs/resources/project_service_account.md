# openai_project_service_account (Resource)

Manage service accounts within a project. A service account is a bot user that is not associated with a user. If a user leaves an organization, their keys and membership in projects will no longer work. Service accounts do not have this limitation. However, service accounts can also be deleted from a project.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "openai_project" "test" {
  name = "my-project"
}

resource "openai_project_service_account" "test" {
  project_id = openai_project.test.id
  name       = "my-service-account"
}

output "service_account_api_key" {
  sensitive = true
  value     = openai_project_service_account.test.api_key
}
```
